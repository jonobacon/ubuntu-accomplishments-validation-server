= Matrix Functionality =

This archive contains the validation service that needs to be run on a third party machine (we call this the 'matrix').

This works by scanning all the Ubuntu One shares from .trophy files that have not been signed. It then adds these to
a queue.

We then process the queue one by one to validate the .trophy files, and if they validate, add a .trophy.sig file.

== Setting Up ==

Create a directory somewhere called "queue".

Create a .matrix file (an example is included, just rename it and edit) and specify where your Ubuntu One
'Shared With Me' directory is and where the 'queue' directory is.

Now add 'libaccomplishment' in the dir to your PYTHONPATH:

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/foo/validation-service/libaccomplishment

== Updating The Queue =

To update the queue, run brit.py:

	python brit.py

This will keep looping as it processes accomplishments.

== Run The Worker ==

Now run the following from the validation-directory and pass it the queue directory:

	./worker.sh /home/foo/queue/
