Ubuntu Accomplishments Validation Server
----------------------------------------

This archive provides the validation server component of the Ubuntu
Accomplishments system. This README explains how to get everything set up.

> Approach <

Ubuntu Accomplishments works by the client detecting if an accomplishment
has been detected and then creating a .trophy file in the user's Ubuntu
One share. This is synced to the validation server where we validate that
it wasn't faked and then GPG sign the file and put it back in the share.
This is then synced back to the client where it is displayed to the user.

The validation server works by having a series of scripts that are
regularly run as cron jobs. These are the scripts:

 * brit.py - this script scans for any .trophy files that have not yet
   been signed. When a file is detected it is added to the queue (as a
   symlink).
 * workerbatch.py - this script reads in all the files in the queue (that
   brit.py queued up) and then processed them to check that they are
   valid. If they are valid they are signed, if not they are deleted.
 * sharecheck.py - this script checks for and accepts share requests (these
   requests are from new Ubuntu Accomplishments users).

One file you may notice too is process-sharecheck which applies a little
DBUS magic to get around an issue with Ubuntu One Headless.

> Requirements <

Currently the following is required:

 * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

> Step 1: Ubuntu One Headless <

An Ubuntu One Headless setup is required. Details of how to set this up
are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/Headless

> Step 2: Install the Required Packages <

Set up the Ubuntu Accomplishments releases PPA and install
the community accomplishments package:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-accomplishments/releases
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-community-accomplishments accomplishments-battery

> Step 3: Set up the validation server <

Create the user account where the installation will run.

Install the bzr branch:

  bzr branch lp:ubuntu-accomplishments-validation-server

Now create the directories we will use for the installation:

  mkdir queue
  mkdir accomplishments

Now create the configuration:

  mkdir ~/.config/accomplishments
  cp .matrixexample ~/.config/accomplishments/.matrix

Now edit ~/.config/accomplishments/.matrix and set the fields:

 * accompath - leave this set to /usr/share/accomplishments
 * sharespath - set this to the location of the Ubuntu One
 'Shared With Me' dir.
 * queuepath - set this to the ~/queue dir.

If you have set up the admin web interface, set 'adminwebpath' to the
web root of that project.

Now set up the crontab for the user:

  crontab -e

Add the following:

  */1 * * * * /home/jono/validation-service/cron_br.sh
  */2 * * * * /home/jono/validation-service/cron_wo.sh
  */2 * * * * /home/jono/validation-service/process-sharecheck
